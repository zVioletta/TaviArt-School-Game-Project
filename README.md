### Current bugs

* [ ] \(Optional) Character animations are still too fast resulting annoying.
* [ ] \(Optional) Jump animation may just be seen by a single frame and then it is overridden by the walking/idle animation.
* [ ] Game Over scene fails to load when using the "vec" variable, hence, it won't load the Game Over minigame (when using this variable, the game won't load).

### Current changes respecting to base reference

* Model changes from a cat to Rock Man
* Background changed from a forest to a city.
* The character is now able to jump with an specific sprite for the animation (may need to implement more so it loops).
* Map is relatively smaller. 
* Changed follower and coins model.
